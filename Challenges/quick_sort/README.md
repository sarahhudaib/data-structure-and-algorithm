# Quick Sort
Author: Sarah Hudaib

## Challenge
Review the given pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Space complexity Big O(logn)
- Time complexity Big O(n^2)
