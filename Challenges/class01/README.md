## Approach & Efficiency

### What approach did i take? 
* Create a function that takes an array.
* We want to get an access into the array by using slicing notation [ : : ]
* Using slice notation we can just go to the last item easily by entering -1 [ : : -1]

### What is the Big O space/time for this approach? 
     Big O ==> O(1)
